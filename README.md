# API Authentication Demo
This little pepites project showcases using API Authentication using various methods like Basic Authentication (Username & Password), API Key and a Bearer Token.

> Note: Currently, it is using a pre-made user on the API website with a API Key and Bearer Token already generated. This is visible in the code. I am working on adding the ability to create a user and then generating their own API Key and Bearer Tokens.

### Progress

- [x] Create basic logic

- [x] Get API Responses in JSON format

- [ ] Ability to accept user registration directly to the API

- [ ] Ability to create API Key and Bearer Token for registered Users
- [ ] Ability to create Personal Secrets for registered Users
